## Node.js && VS2015

Tried to install VS2015 on my machine, and realize it might not work well with node...well, why not just give it a try? Not surprisingly it didn't work smoothly(especially when you need to compile C++ addons).

1. Run `npm config set msvs_version 2015 --global`[Could not load the Visual C++ component "VCBuild.exe".](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/8169)
2. Do [this](https://breeswish.org/blog/2014/11/14/node-gyp-rebuild-freeze/) if you can't download the node source code or the hash just can't get right
3. Update node-gyp manually [Updating npm's bundled node gyp](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-gyp/wiki/Updating-npm's-bundled-node-gyp)
4. Try apply the config locally if 1 doesn't work: [Unable to install on Windows 7: Failed to execute 'node-gyp.cmd rebuild...'](https://github.com/node-inspector/v8-profiler/issues/47)


## Ask bower to use https:// instead of git://

Tried to solve this problem for my teammate(who doesn't have a github account with SSH keys set up).

1. Run this:

  ```bash
  git config --global url."https://".insteadOf git://
  ```
2. If it doesn't work(under Windows), check your environment variables:

  ```
  echo %USERPROFILE%
  echo %HOMEDRIVE%
  echo %HOME%
  ```
  
  If `%HOME%` wasn't set, try to set it to the same directory as `%USERPROFILE%`(as a user variable!)

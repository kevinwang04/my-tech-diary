## Reference

I've been working on a simple jQuery-inspired wrapper for SVG elements(yes, there are some quirks), and this list could be useful:

### DOM and Event Manipulation

* [DOMtastic](https://github.com/webpro/DOMtastic)
  * Has [a very nice documentation](http://webpro.github.io/DOMtastic/doc/)(you can checkout the API and the source side-by-side)
  * Written in ES6, and plays very well with it.
  * No AJAX or animation or the like. It's pretty compact.
* [zepto](https://github.com/madrobby/zepto/)
  * Well-known solution for mobiles.
  * Very modular. Simpler than jQuery, but heavier than DOMtastic.
* [min.js](https://github.com/remy/min.js)
  * Extremely simple.
  * Even less feature than DOMtastic, a quick look should suffice.
* [knockout/util.js](https://github.com/knockout/knockout/blob/master/src/utils.js)
  * Complicated, but contains a bunch of useful polyfills
* [backbone.native](https://github.com/inkling/backbone.native/blob/master/backbone.native.js)
  * Just enough to get the backbone going.

### Pointer Events

* [tap.js](https://github.com/pukhalski/tap)
  * It intercept pointer events, and fire fake events instead.
* [Unifying touch and mouse: how Pointer Events will make cross-browsers touch support easy](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/davrous/archive/2013/02/20/handling-touch-in-your-html5-apps-thanks-to-the-pointer-events-of-ie10-and-windows-8.aspx)
  * Proposed by M$. Only IE10 has good support for it, Firefox implemented it recently. M$ has submitted a patch for WebKit long ago, but it never made it...

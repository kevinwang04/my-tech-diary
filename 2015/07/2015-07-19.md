## Polymer

### `on-tap`, `on-click`, `on-iron-select`, `on-iron-activate`

`on-iron-activate` happens first, then `on-iron-select`.

`on-iron-activate` and `on-iron-select` don't always happen when you click on a `<paper-menu>`, but `on-click` and `on-tap` almost always do(but you need to do event delegation your self, which is not pretty). Looks like a bug of the paper element(and I have become used to discover bugs in Polymer 1.0....).

### Reload

Do not change your attribute in your attribute observer(which often happens indirectly when you are not being careful)....that's just silly. With a slow AJAX it could keep firing mutation events, and you will see a lot of absurd things happen...

### `<paper-menu>`

Oh it's just a pain to work with....The `<paper-item>` can leak their ripples if they are wrapped in some intermediate elements(e.g. you created a custom elements wrapping it), and they can just lose their ripples for no reason at all. And don't even get me started on the unreliable `on-iron-select` and `on-iron-activate`... They don't even have submenus!!! How can you call this 1.0?!

## JS

### Easy date format

```js
// to yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss (no guarantee for leading zeros though)
function formatDate(date) {
  var dict = ['Jan','Feb','Mar','Apr','May','Jun','Jul','Aug','Sep','Oct','Nov','Dec'];
  var c = date.toString().match(/\w+ (\w+) (\d+) (\d+) (\d+:\d+:\d+)/);
  var month = dict.indexOf(c[1]) + 1;
  return [c[3], month, c[2]].join('-') + ' ' + c[4];
}
```

## Express

### Error

Don't throw....I keep forgetting about it. Do this:

```js
var err = new Error("Some error message");
    err.status = 404;  // or any other status code
    next(err);
```

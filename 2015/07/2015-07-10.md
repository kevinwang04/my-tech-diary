## Work

First day at work...Spent most of the day attending meetings(it's a big company after all), setting up the computer, installing environments, setting up accounts, .etc.

My first task is to implement a pie chart with pop-up tables. The rest of the afternoon is dedicated to setting up Grunt and bower to manage the chores(can't get livereload working via `file:///` though), maybe I've gone too far...apparently I don't really need these to get my demo working. -_-

Read the getting started guide of Highcharts. It's pretty easy to get started with.

There are a few internal tools that looks interesting. I've never known the existence of some of them...

## CG

Finally decided to use glm and FLTK...they ain't pretty, but they do the job. Really don't have much time for this, I've got too much on my plate right now so forgive me for being lazy...o_O

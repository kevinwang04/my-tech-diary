## CSS

### When you need to apply margins in-between

```css
.selector + .selector {
  margin-left: 10px;
}
```

And [this(adjacent sibling selector)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Adjacent_sibling_selectors) is supported in IE7+!

## SVG

### `text.getComputedTextLength()`

It's really hard to avoid the Firefox bug where calling `getBBox()` before the element is rendered will throw a `NS_ERROR_FAILURE` -- in many cases the SVG needs to be hidden at first, and only displayed when some event is fired. A simple workaround for `<text>` elements is to use `text.getComputedTextLength()` instead. This is particularly helpful when you need to layout some text "spans".

Note that SVG2 has [a lot more text layout attributes](http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG2/text.html) including text wrapping, but unfortunately only Chrome has a good for it for the moment.

## Docker

### [A sample Docker workflow with Nginx, Node.js and Redis](http://anandmanisankar.com/posts/docker-container-nginx-node-redis-example/)

Looks like a nice tutorial. Maybe I'll have a walkthrough when I had the time.

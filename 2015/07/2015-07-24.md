## CSS

### To make your table styled easier

```
table-layout: fixed
```

By [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/table-layout):

> Table and column widths are set by the widths of table and col elements or by the width of the first row of cells. Cells in subsequent rows do not affect column widths.


## Angular

### Replace `{{}}` with something else

Someone asked me how to avoid the `{{}}` conflict of Angular when the backend templates are also using it, turned out you can use [`$interpolateProvider`](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/provider/$interpolateProvider) to change the interpolation symbol.

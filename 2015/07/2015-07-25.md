## FRP

### ["Controlling Time and Space: understanding the many formulations of FRP" by Evan Czaplicki](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Agu6jipKfYw)

* Signal graphs instead of callbacks
* Values changing over time(mouse positions, keys)
* Input, transform, state, merge
  * `lift: (a -> b) -> Signal a -> Signal b`
  * `foldp : (a -> b -> b) -> b -> Signal a -> Signal b`
  * `merge : Signal a -> Signal a -> Signal a`
  * `lift2 : (a -> b -> c ) -> Signal a -> Signal b -> Signal c`

#### Core design

* Signals are connected to the world
* Signals are infinite(you can't throw it away)
* Signal graphs are static(known structure)
* Synchronous by default(order is maintained, properties are not shared)

#### Benefits in Elm

* Efficiency. Everything is send through events.
* Architecture: can be broken up into Model-Update-Display
* Hot swapping: change the behavior while the program is running
* Time travel debugger: Go back in time!

#### Higher order FRP

* `join: Signal (Signal a) -> Signal a`
  * Picking one signal from a signal of signals to handle
  * Problems: Create a new signal needs infinite look back -> memory grow with time
  * Solution: only switch to signals that have safe amounts of history
    * Can try to look back unless you specify you want to

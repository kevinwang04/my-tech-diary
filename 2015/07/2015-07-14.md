## Highcharts demo

* Update instead of insert
* Clean the code. Add $ to jQuery objects, use better names, etc.

### Drilldown

* Checkout [this tutorial](http://www.highcharts.com/docs/chart-concepts/drilldown)
* To reduce the data point to top-N and "others", sort the data by y(decreasing), then `splice` into two halves(`n - 1, length - n + 1`). Put the `splice`d part(tail) into `drilldown`, and add a `others` data point with a `drilldown` point to that part.

## CV

Trained a cascade classifier with  7000 positive samples(28x28) and 9000 negative samples(100x100), the preset number of stages is 10 but it ends early(of course...). It took about 5 hours to train this, and the results are actually not bad...not bad at all...

However I ran into some problems in the recognition part. The SVM that comes with sklearn produces ridiculous results, and they take quite some time to train(according to the documentation it's O(n^3)!!!!). Maybe I should try the one in OpenCV instead?

### [Compacting Garbage Collection in SpiderMonkey](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2015/07/compacting-garbage-collection-in-spidermonkey/)

#### Arena

* Blocks of memory, 4K in total, the JS heap
  * Divided into fixed-size cells
  * Cells in the same arena have the same size and kind
* Type of cells
  * JS objects, strings, symbols(most memory)
  * Scripts(JS code)
  * Shapes(represent layout of objects)
  * JIT code
* Problem
  * Can't be free as long as it has live cells
  * Fragmentation: many arena have only a few cells, but can't be filled with cells of other kinds/sizes
  * Can't be returned to OS when memory is low

#### Measure wasted memory

* To see the memory report, enter `about:memory`
  * `js-main-runtime-gc-heap-commited/unused/gc-things`
  * [Doc](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Performance/about:memory)
* Reduce 2% of total allocations/8% OF JS heap


#### Compacting

* Merge live cells in sparse arenas, reuse memory
* Difficulties:
  * Update every pointer to the moved cells
  * Scanning could be expensive
    * Solution: only do this when memory is low/user is inactive
* Steps
  1. Figure out the cells to move
  2. Move them
  3. Update pointers to them

#### 1. Selecting cells to move

* Goal
  * Move minimum amount of data
  * No need for additional memory
* How
  1. Sort all non-full arena by number of free cells
  2. Split in two, the first one have **enough free space to accommodate cells in the other**
  3. The second half will be moved

#### 2. Move the cells

1. Allocate a new cell in one of the arenas in the first half
2. Move the data over
3. Update self-contained pointers
4. Update the original location with a pointer to the new location(GC will know it's been moved)

#### 3. Update pointers

* The heap is split into zones(e.g. one zone per tab)
  * Compacting is performed per zone, because usually there are no cross-zone pointers
* Some kinds of cells can be excluded(can't have pointers anyway)
* Parallelize
* This needs exact stack rooting for avoiding overwriting unrelated data on the stack

#### Triggers

1. Run out of memory
2. Memory pressure event by OS
3. User has been inactive for some length of time(e.g. 20s)

## Architecture

### [5 Common Server Setups For Your Web Application](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/5-common-server-setups-for-your-web-application)

#### 1. Everything on one server

* e.g. LAMP
* Web server, application server, database server all-in-one
* Use case: quick setup
* Pros
  * Simple
* Cons
  * App and DB contend for resources
  * Not scalable

#### 2. Seperate DB server

* Use case: quick setup with a few improvements, vertical scaling
* Pros
  * No competition between DB and app
  * You can scale each tier
  * Security: DB doesn't connect to DMZ(public networks)
* Cons
  * More complex
  * Latency of connection between the two servers is critical

#### 3. Load Balancer(Reverse Proxy)

* e.g. HAProxy, Nginx, Varnish
* Use case: Horizontal scaling(add more servers)
* Pros
  * Horizontal scaling
  * Protection against DDOS
* Cons
  * Configuration of the load balancer is important. It can become the bottleneck.
  * Complexities(e.g. SSL termination, sticky sessions)

#### 4. HTTP Accelerator(Caching Reverse Proxy)

* Cache HTTP response
* e.g. Varnish, Squid, Nginx
* Use case: content-heavy dynamic web applications, commonly accessed file
* Pros
  * Performance
  * Also serve as a reverse proxy load balancer
  * Caching against DDOS
* Cons
  * Configuration is critical
  * Low cache-hit rate can reduce the performance

#### 5. Master-Slave Database Replication

* Updates are sent to the master, reads are distributed across all nodes(or slaves)
* Use case: read is more frequent than writes
* Pros
  * DB performance
* Cons
  * App needs to be aware of this
  * Updates to slaves are asynchronous, so their content could be out-of-date sometimes
  * Can't update anymore if the master fails, and doesn't have failover for it.

#### Combined

* Load balance caching servers and application servers
* Use database replication

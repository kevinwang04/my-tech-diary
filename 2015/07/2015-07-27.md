## SVG

### Reuse with `<defs>` and `<use>`

Note you need `xlink:href` to link your `id`.

```xml
<defs>
    <!-- A circle of radius 200 -->
    <circle id="s1" cx="200" cy="200" r="200" fill="yellow" stroke="black"/>
</defs>
<use x="100" y="100" xlink:href = "#s1"/>
```

### `<marker>`s

```xml
<defs>
    <marker id="Triangle"
            viewBox="0 0 10 10" 
            refX="1" refY="5"
            markerWidth="6" 
            markerHeight="6"
            orient="auto">
        <!-- What's inside your marker -->
        <path d="M 0 0 L 10 5 L 0 10 z" />
  </marker>
</defs>

<polyline points="10,90 50,80 90,20"
          fill="none" stroke="black" 
          stroke-width="2"
          marker-end="url(#Triangle)" />
          <!-- Notice `marker-end` -->
```

## CSS

### [`border-radius: 50%` or `border-radius: 100%`](http://jessica-eldredge.com/2014/09/07/border-radius-50-or-100-percent/)

* Percentages are calculated against the width and the height of your element, so `50%` is what you really want(The radius is half of the width/height, which is very reasonable)
* Why does `100%` work? Because by the spec, if the rounded shape is larger than it's original slice, the browser need to **scale the shape until it fits inside its original slice**
* So, use `50%`!

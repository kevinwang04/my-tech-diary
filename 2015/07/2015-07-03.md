### [How fast are web workers?](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2015/07/how-fast-are-web-workers/)

[Benchmark](https://github.com/gmarty/web-workers-benchmark)

#### Workers

* Web workers
  * Can only talk to the main thread
* Shared workers
  * Can talk to all threads **under the same origin**
  * Including threads in other tabs/iframes/other shared workers
  * Lifetime is controlled by the browser
  * You can use [BroadcastChannel](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2015/02/broadcastchannel-api-in-firefox-38/) to broadcast messages among them
* Service workers
  * Can serve as proxy(combined with caching you've got offline apps)

#### Cost of instantiation

* 40ms on Firefox OS with Flame
* Note: 60fps => 16.66ms per frame, so any JS code running longer than that will introduce jankiness
* Solution: pool. **Reuse your workers**.
* 1ms for creating broadcast channel

#### Message lantency

* 0~1ms to post a message, 1~2ms to broadcast a message

#### Size of message

* Transferring message
  * The sender can no longer use it once sent
  * Almost instantaneous
  * Only ArrayBuffer can be transferred
* 45kb/ms for `postMessage`, 6kb/ms for broadcasting
* To fit the frame rate, keep the data under 350MB for `postMessage` and under 50MB when using broadcast channels.
* Objects will take longer to post. Try serialize them into a binary format like [`Protocol Buffer`](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/)

## Docker

### [Introduction to Docker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5POuMHxW-0)

* Started out as a side project in DotCloud
* Standards of containers
  * Software stack and versions
* The spectrum
  * VM ---------- Docker ------------ Binaries/packages
* Made possible by Linux Namespace/Control groups for sandboxing
* Docker is much more concise and simple than the old system used in dotCloud
  * It should be an ingredient for a system
* Static binary with CLI, run as a daemon

#### Demo

* `docker ps` to list running processes
* `docker image` to see the available images
* `docker run <repo>:<tag> <process>` to run the image(create a copy for it like a fork!)
* LMAO hahahahha he `rm -fr /bin` to prove his point!
* `docker diff <containerid>` to see the changes in the container
* `docker commit` to commit the changes
* `docker push`, `docker pull`
  * docker does versioning(copy-on-write)
  * Only changes will be transferred, so the push and pull are fast

#### Integration with CI
  * Create a container, install dependencies in it, upload the code, compile
  * The base image is fat, but the upper layer is thin

#### Network services/Containers depending on containers

* `-p <port>` to tell docker the container is gonna expose something through `<port>` when doing `docker run`
* Docker will configure the iptables for you
* `docker ps` will show which port on the host is mapped to the specified port on the container(e.g. `40132(host)->8000(container)`)
* Docker is not responsible for service discovery(UNIX KISS principle)
* Container links
* Recommendation: pack external dependencies into containers
  * So you can do dependency injection in all layers of your stack
  * e.g. a mock database container/mock API container & a production database container/real API
  * You don't even need network connections when doing integration tests!

#### About git

* Docker is used as binary...You don't merge binaries LOL
* Just rebuild on check

### [Docker and Go: why did we decide to write Docker in Go?](http://www.slideshare.net/jpetazzo/docker-and-go-why-did-we-decide-to-write-docker-in-go)

#### Pros

1. Static binaries with just `go build`
  * Easy to install/test/adopt
  * Good for bootstrap
2. Neutral(hmm...)
3. Async, low-level, standard library, data types, strong duck typing
4. Dev environment
  * `go doc` (see docs)
  * `go get` (fetch dependencies)
  * `go fmt` (tabs v.s. spaces)
  * `go test`
  * `go run` (REPL)
5. Multi-arch build(easily portable)

#### Cons

* Doesn't solve any problem?
  * Easier than Erlang
  * More real than Rust
  * Dv2? hmm...
* Maps are not thread-safe
  * They are fast because of it
  * You need to protect it your self
  * Channels of channels
* `go get` can't pin a particular revision
  * Had to import the source code
  * Private repos need manual operations
* `go test`doesn't have cleanups
  * `z_final_test.go`
* `go build`
  * Painful to build multiple binaries sharing common code
  * Programs has to be on its own, and be `main`
* flag package is crippled
  * Just don't use it!
  * Use getopt or go-flags
* Error handling (LOL)
  * Use panic/recover internally
  * One-off utility types
* Can't select on readers/writers
  * Reduce everything to channels

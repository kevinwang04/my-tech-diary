Been reviewing CG all day...

## CH1 Basics
* Pixel: elementary unit of image
  * Image: array of pixels
  * Area
  * Color
* Frame buffer
  * A buffer that stores the contents of an image pixel by pixel, usually on graphic cars
* Double buffering: two separate buffers, one is displayed when the other is being filled, repeatedly swapped to avoid flicker
* Resolution: the number of pixels per square inch on a computer-generated display
* Raster: TODO


### Pipeline

1. Geometry Content
2. Geometry Processing
  * Model/View Transform
  * Lighting
  * Perspective Transform
  * Clipping
3. Rasterization
  * Scan Conversion
  * Texturing
4. Fragment Processing
  * Depth Test
  * Blending
5. Frame buffer

Primitives in, pixels out.

### Primitives

* Complex shapes: spheres, cones, etc.
* Simple shapes: triangles
* Complex primitives with parameters
  * Functions
  * Splines, NURBS
  * Implicit

#### Mathematical representation

* Explicit functions(mostly works in 2D)
  * Curves
    * y = sin(x)
  * Surfaces
    * z = sin(x) + cos(y)
* Parametric functions
  * Curves
    * C(t) = [cost, sint, t]
  * Surfaces
    * S(phi, theta) = [cos(phi)cos(theta), sin(phi)cos(theta), sin(theta)]
* Implicit
  * Surfaces
    * Defined by zero sets(roots) of functions
    * e.g. S(x, y, z): x^2 + y^2 + z^2 -1 = 0


### Model/View Transformation

* Modeling transformation
  * Local coor -> world coor
  * Placing objects
* Viewing transformation
  * World coor -> camera coor
  * Placing camera
* Types of transformations
  * Rotation
  * Scaling
  * Shearing

### Lighting

* Brightness, material property and light position
* Per vertex

### Perspective Transform

* 3D geometry -> 2D image plane
* Eye coor -> device coor

### Clipping

* Remove pixels not in viewport

### Rasterization Scan conversion

* Continuous -> discrete
* Triangle setup -> triangle traversal -> pixel shading -> merging

### Texture mapping

* Glue image onto geometry
* Look up the image for fragment colors

### Depth Test

* Remove parts of geometry hidden behind others
* Per fragment
  * Depth buffer
* Object space
  * Clipping polygons
  * Sort by distance from camera

### Blending

* Write fragments to pixels
* From farthest to nearest
* Blending colors

## CH2 OpenGL

* Display list
  * Pre compiled
  * Fast
  * Stored on GPU

## How OpenGL Works

* 3 stages
  * Define objects in the world
  * Modeling and viewing transformations
  * Render
* It's a state machine
  * Has defaults
  * Won't change until you specify

### Details of OpenGL Program

* Context
* Viewport
  * A region of pixels on the screen that can see the context
  * Part of the window
  * Can have multiple viewports in one window `glViewport()`
* States
  * `glEnable()`, `glDisable()`
  * Color, camera(location, orientation, fov), lighting, primitives(fixed pipeline), line width/shape...
* `glBegin()`, `glVertex*()`, `glEnd()`
* `glFlush()`, `glFinish()` 

### Matrices

* Camera is always at (0, 0, 0) looking at -z direction, so you are actually moving the scene instead of the camera.
* Push and pop matrices onto stacks.
* Column-major and right-multiply top of the stack
* Last pushed, first applied
* `glMatrixMode`

#### ModelView

* 3D -> 3D
* Object coordinates to eye
* Model + view transformation
* Model
  * Positioning the object
  * Rotate, translate, scale
* View
  * Positioning the camera
* `glTranslate`, `glRotate`(counter-clockwise, degrees), `glScale`
* `gluLookAt`(eye, at, up).
  * Image you are looking at `at` when your head is at `eye`, then your head can be pointing at any direction(tilting),  so you need the `up` vector to specify where your head is pointing at.


#### Projection

* 3D -> 2D
* Eye coordinates to clip(device) coordinates
* Projection & clipping
* Perspective
  * foreshortening
  * Like a truncated pyramid, aka **frustum**
  * `glFrustum` and `gluPerspective`
* Orthographic
  * Not foreshortening, everything is just flat
  * `glOrtho`, `glOrtho2D`
    * `glOrtho2D` clips in [-1.0, 1.0] in z, so in 2D mode the frustum is the viewport.


#### Transforms

* 4x4 matrices
* `glLoadIdentity`, `glLoadMatrix*`, `glMultMatrix*`
* **column-major**, the opposite of how C/C++ store matrices(you count the numbers first top-to-bottom, then left-to-right)
* Last transform(in code) is applied first.
  * Usually you want to rotate first, then translate so you can rotate the object around its center. Then in your code you need to translate first, then rotate.

## CH3 Rasterization

### Requirements for line conversion

* Close to the ideal line
* Straight
* Constant brightness
* Start and end should be accurate
* Efficient
* Possible for different line styles

### DDA

* `X1 + i => y` ?(rounding)
*`y - mx + c = 0`, slope is m
  * `x[i] = x[i-1] + 1`, `y[i] = y[i-1] + m`
  * Illuminate `[x[i], round(y[i])]`
* Problem: when `m > 1`, the line is not continuous
  * Solution: Illuminate by stepping y: `x[i] = x[i-1] + 1/m`,` y[i] = y[i-1] + 1`

```
int dx = xb - xa,
    dy = yb - ya,
    steps;

float incx, incy;  // increment
float x = xa, y = ya;  // current

// m > 1?
if (abs(dx) > abs(dy))
  steps = abs(dx);
else
  steps = abs(dy);

incx = dx / (float)steps;  // 1 or 1/m
incy = dy / (float) steps;  / m or 1

setPixel(round(x), round(y)); // start
for (int i = 0; i < steps; ++i) {
  x += incx; y += incy;
  setPixel(round(x), round(y));
}
```

### Bresenham

#### Consider distance and choose between two points

* Assume` y'[i+1] = mx'[i+1] + B` and m <= 1, For `x[i], y[i]`, the next point must be `x[i]+1, y[i]`(right) or `x[i]+1, y[i] + 1`(top-right)
* Compare distance
  * `dupper = y[i] + 1 - y'[i+1] = y[i] + 1 - mx'[i+1] - B`
  * `dlower = y'[i+1] - y[i] =  mx'[i+1] + B - y[i]`
  * `dlower - dupper = 2m(x'[i] + 1) - 2y[i] + 2B - 1`
  * Same sign as `p[i] = dx * (dlower - dupper)`
* If `p[i] > 0`, choose top-right, if `p[i] < 0`, choose the right one, else anyone(prefer right).
* Note `p[i+1] - p[i] = ... = 2dy - 2dx(y[i+1] - y[i])`
  * If `p[i] <= 0`, `y[i+1] = y[i]`, so `p[i+1] = p[i] + 2dy`(right)
  * Else `y[i+1] - y[i] = 1` so `p[i+1] = p[i] + 2dy - 2dx`(top-right)

```
line(x1, y1, x2, y2) {
  int x = x1, y = y1,
      dx = x2 - x1,
      dy = y2 - y1,
      p = 2 * dy - dx,
      de = 2 * dy  // step for right
      dne = 2 * (dy - dx);  // step for top-right
  
  setPixel(x, y);  // start

  while(x < x2) {
    if (p < 0) {
      x += 1;  // right
      p += de;  // update
    } else {
      x += 1; y += 1;  // top right
      p += dne;  // update
    }
    setPixel(x, y); // draw this new pixel
  }
}
```

### Flood fill

* Hard to determine if the point is inside
* Multiple checks
* Double the memory to store visited flags

```
floodFill(Polygon p, int x, int y) {
  if (!p.onBoundary(x, y) && !p.colored(x, y)) {
    setPixel(x, y);
    floodFill(p, x+1, y);  // right
    floodFill(p, x, y+1);  // down
    floodFill(p, x, y-1);  // top
    floodFill(p, x-1, y);  // left
  }
}
```

### Scan line

* Find intersections of edges and the scan line
* Sort intersections by x
* Fill pixels between pair of intersections
* Improvement
  * Use slope to calculate the x for the next intersection
  * Maintain list of active edges
  * Good for convex polygons, much better for triangles
* Sp cases
  * Intersection with two edges and the scanline
  * Horizontal edges
* Advantages
  * Efficient
  * Each px is visited once
  * Good for shading, convex, triangles


#### Edge walking: trapezoid

```
scanTrapezoid(xL, xR, yB, yT, dxL, dxR) {
  // xL, xR: x for left/right foot
  // yB, yT: y for bottom/top edge
  // dxL, dxR: slope for left/right edge
  for (y: yB...yT) {
    for (x: xL...xR) {  // line
      setPixel(x, y);
    }
    xL += dxL; xR+= dxR; // update x
  }
}
```

#### Convex

* For every pair of point in the shape, any point on the line through them is also in the shape
* For all x and y in C and all t:[0, 1], (1-t)x + ty is in C

#### Edge Walking: triangles

* Split triangles into two by a horizontal line
* Edge walk these two triangles
* Problem
  * Small triangles needs huge setup cost
  * Clipping produces non-triangles(re-triangulation)

#### Rasterization Issues

* Which pixels? Insiders of course, but what about edges? 

### Bounding box

* Boundary: min and max of x and y of vertices for the triangle
* Traverse every pixels in the box, lit anyone inside the triangle

Finals!!!!!!! Arrived at panic station!!!

## C++

Ported my random forest to Linux and did some refactoring...([commits](https://github.com/joyeecheung/parallel-random-forest/commits/master)). MinGW32 4.8.1 doesn't have `std::stoi` and `std::stod` ported, had to resort to `strtol` and `strtod`.

Figured out this way to tell Premake5 to use clang (don't know why but clearly `premake gmake --cc=clang` just doesn't work):

```lua
configuration "clang"
   toolset "clang"
```

and run `make config=clang` when using the makefile generated.

  * The point about Web App: on-demand(I agree.)
  * React & webpack
    * Entry points
    * Not only js
  * CSS
    * Namespace is very important in SPA
    * No cascading
    * No overwriting
  * Web at its strength, mobile at its strength
  * Hundreds of react modules per page, each has its js and css(siting next to each other in the same directory), the optimizer takes care of bundling them
  * Testing
    * Do prototype first, only start to test when the pieces come together
    * [Huxley](https://github.com/facebookarchive/huxley) takes screenshots and pixel-compare to test CSS
    * Integration test on shapes of JSON coming out of the backend
  * Bundling
    * Webpack loaders compiles JSX to vanilla JS, then optimize
      * Incremental compilation
  * Static assets
    * In development, grab from django
    * In production, configure django to use CDN
    * Upload to CDN first, then update the database to switch to the new configuration

  * Use hidden classes to generate code that uses offsets instead of doing look-ups
  * Inline cache will validate the hidden class first though. If the validation fails, uses runtime routine.
  * Two-generation garbage collector, reclaim resources incrementally

* Fragmentation is also one of the motivations for a multi-process model
* Plugins also have seperate processes
* Crawlers help to build test cases based on ranking in Google Search
* Schematic UI test
* All pointers are known, no need to poke around
  * Other browsers(at 2008) will search for pointers

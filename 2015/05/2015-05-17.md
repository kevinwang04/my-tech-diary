## A static site generator for diaries like this!

Spent a few hours today to get [this](https://github.com/joyeecheung/diary) working...Use jade for layout templates, marked and highlight.js to generate markup, PostCSS for styles, and gulp to build and deploy.

The diary repo itself is just a git submodule inside the generator. Every page will have a title generated from the filename (in `YYYY-MM-DD.md`) using moment.js.

This is way easier to develop than I thought! But it still needs a good index page, I'm thinking about using [this](http://fullcalendar.io/) or [this](http://kylestetz.github.io/CLNDR/).

The generated page for this post: [Click me](http://joyeecheung.github.io/diary/2015/05/2015-05-17.html).

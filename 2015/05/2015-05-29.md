## History -- ES4

So in conclusion, DC was the idealist, BE was the practicalist, M$ was ... well, M$. Adobe and JR helped out a lot. Spidermonkey was leading in browser implementations. That type system, package and namespace were quite radical. Unfortunately the TC split, and ES4 eventually failed.

### Process of ES standardization

* Champions design features(1-2 expers)
* TC39 and web developers give feedbacks
* Field-testing and refining
* TC39 votes

### Symbols

* Like ids, but can help you avoid name clashes on object indexing
* Public symbols like `Symbol.iterator`

### Object Literals

* Shorter method definitions like ES5 getters/setters, much more compact

  ```javascript
  let obj = {
    methodA() {
      // ...
    },
    methodB = {
      // ...
    }
  }
  ```
* Property values

  ```javascript
  let x = 1, y = 2;
  let obj = {x, y};  // like {x: x, y: y}
  ```
* Computed property keys(needs `[]`)

  ```javascript
  let someKey = 'foo';

  let obj = {
    ['o' + 'a']: 1,
    [someKey]() {
      return 2;
    }
  }
  ```
* Named Parameters

  ```javascript
  function foo(bar, {x, y}) {
    return [x, y];
  }
  foo(1, {x: 'a', y: 'b'}); // ['a', 'b']
  ```

## jQuery

## OpenGL

### CH1

* **buffer object**: object representing OpenGL-managed memory (could be in GPU). Can store things like vertex data.
* **input variables**, **output variables**: variables in global scope of the shader, passed through the pipeline
* **vertex attribute**: input variables to vertex shaders. 
  * Each vertex attribute is a vector(length <= 4) and has an index.
  * Connection between buffer object(could be holding a lot of vertex data) and the vertex attribute(e.g. each 4 elements in the buffer object) can be made (in your normal program) by `glVertexAttribPointer()` and `glEnableVertexAttribArray()`.
  * In the shader you can get back the index with `glGetAttribLocation()`.
* **viewport transform**: normalized device coordinate space -> window space

## ES6
###[ES6 In Depth: Iterators and the for-of loop](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2015/04/es6-in-depth-iterators-and-the-for-of-loop/)

* for-of are for Arrays, not old Objects
* Use `[Symbol.iterator]` to define how to loop an Object (like `__iter__()` in python)
  * This is awesome:

    ```javascript
    jQuery.prototype[Symbol.iterator] = Array.prototype[Symbol.iterator];
    ```
* Implement `Iter.next` as function who returns `{done: Boolean, value: xxx}`
* for-of is basically calling `Obj.next()` on something returned by `Obj[Symbol.iterator]()` repeatedly and stop when `next` return `done: true`
* destructuring + Map makes you feel like you are writing python LOL

###[ES6 and ES7 the future of Javascript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AytbSdWBKg)

* Some history about ECMA and ECMAScript
  * < 2011 still pretty closed, >= 2011 open and up on GitHub
  * Why word document: ISO want it... plan to switch to Markdown
* Hard to find names for new built-ins
  * Engines can JIT them
  * Example: `String.prototype.includes` instead of `String.prototype.contains` because it can break Mootools
* Templates
  * Me: ugh...won't this cause problems for minification?
* `isFinite` -> `Number.isFinite`, `isNaN` -> `Number.isNaN`, they don't do coersions!
* `var` comes from the era when people think global scope and local scope is enough for scripting languages...now we konw that is a miskate, so we have `let` with block scope.
* Arrow function
  * Lexical `this`, handy for `setTimeout` etc.
  * Not `new`able(not constructors)
  * No `arguments`
  * Classes are just sugar
    * No implicit `super` call because in dynamic languages it is error-prone
* Modules
  * Browserify is doing what the interpreter supposed to do

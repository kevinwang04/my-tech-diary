## Type Rendering

### [A Closer Look At Font Rendering](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/04/24/a-closer-look-at-font-rendering/)

#### Rasterization
* Black-and-white(bi-rendering), still used in prints, but not good in low-resolution screens
* Grayscale rendering -- antialiasing, smooth contour
* Colored pixels(subpixels) -- resolution is trippled in horizontal direction

#### Implementations
* Browsers uses system rasterizers
  * On windows: GDI ClearType, GDI grayscale, or DirectWrite
    * Format matters
* WOFF is a wrapper type
* TrueType(.eot, .ttf) and PostScript(.otf) differ in
  * Curve representation (doesn't matter that much to rasterizer)
  * Hinting representation
    * PostScript contains **abstract** info about hinting
    * TrueType contains **specific** instructions that controls the rendering

#### GDI Grayscale
* XP has only grayscale rendering
* Applies to both TrueType and PostScript
* Good at hinting in PostScript
* Suprisingly good without hinting

#### ClearType
* Vista and Win7 have ClearType
* Only applies to **TrueType** fonts
* Subpixel in horizontal direction, black-and-white in vertical direction
  * No anti-aliasing in vertical direction!
  * Wired jaggies at curves
  * Worse in large sizes
* Without hinting, there will be "warts"... :(

#### DirectWrite
* IE9+
* ClearType + vertical smoothing
* Applies to **PostScript** fonts too
* Contours will be aligned to full pixel heights, which can give good results when hinting is provided, but also means wired results without hinting(in vertical direction)
* Allows subpixel positioning

#### Mac OS X Quartz
* Hinting is ignored, so TrueType and PostScript are rendered in the same way.
* Good subpixel rendering
* Doesn't try that hard
* Does not enforce full pixel height alignement

#### iOS
* Almost the same as OS X, but without subpixel rendering(grayscale only, doesn't enforce full height, doesn't care about hinting)

#### Conclusion
* Mac OS and iOS: reliable, but sometimes too heavy
* Windows: hinting matters, especially for TrueType. PostScript > TrueType.
* IE8- = ClearType(if installed) = jaggies, needs good hinting to come in rescue
* DirectWrite is good with hinting, but you need IE9+.
* In my experience, in China XP might not even have grayscale...? Just terrible black-and-white.

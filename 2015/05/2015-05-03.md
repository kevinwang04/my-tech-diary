## ES6
###[ES6 and ES7 the future of Javascript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AytbSdWBKg)
* Default arguments can reference lexical scope
* No default iterators, you need to implement them to use them
* Am I looking at python? LOL

  ```javascript
  function *items(o) {
    for (var k in o) {
      yield [k, o[k]];
    }
  }

  for (var [k, v] of items({a: 1, b: 2, c: 3})) {
    print(k, v);
  }
  ```
* Promises can help to reduce excessive closures(take up too much memory) by **passing** variables down


## Dev Tools
### [Wait, Chrome Dev Tools could do THAT?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaneWEqNcpE)
* Remember to tweak the settings(log AJAX, etc.)
* Shortcuts
  * Ctrl + Space: Autocompletion
  * Alt + -: Jump to previous editing location
  * Alt + +: Jump to next editing location
  * Ctrl + E: Start/stop recording(timeline/profile)
  * Ctrl + Shift + F: Search across all sources
  * Ctrl + P: Go to source
* Network tab
  * Sizes(trasferred/acutal size) check if gize is working properly
  * Time(latency: time until first byte/time until finished), check the connection
  * Click the "timeine" header(wow that was deep..) and sort by lantency, start time, etc.
  * Browsers are better at scheduling downloading resources initiated by parser(script loader is slower)
    * download flushed reference early
    * preload is faster than JS execution
  * WebSocket -- filter them out
  * save as HAR to send network snapshot to other people
* Rendering
  * Seperate DOM and CSS as much as you can(synchronization slow things down)
  * ESC->Rendering to find out bottlenecks
    * Show paint rectangles to find repaints
    * The smaller the repainted area, the better.
  * Animation
    * Frame loss: janking
    * Webworker/split: allow the browser to paint the frames when doing computations instead of "a bunch of computation, then paint"

  * Console API copy: `copy(document.body.innerText)`
  * `clear()`
  * `inspect()` to jump from DOM node in console to inspector
  * `$0` to reference inspected DOM element in console
  * Network
    * Blue line: DOMContent event fired(DOM loaded)
    * Red line: Load event(imgs, iframes..)
    * Cookies tab
    * `ctrl-g` or `cmd-g` to jump to lines in JS
    * Pause button to break on exception

## Graceful degradation, progressive enhancement
[Graceful degradation versus progressive enhancement](http://www.w3.org/wiki/Graceful_degradation_versus_progressive_enhancement)

* Graceful degradation: build for the latest and the best browsers first, when the user uses an old browser, tell them the functionality won't work or just display a less nice-looking page(you might **leave something deformed** on your page).
* Progressive enhancement: build for all common browsers first, then add advanced functionality for newer browsers. If something won't work in the old browser, just don't add it to the basic version(you **don't even leave a trace** for anything that wouldn't work in old browsers).

## About the specs

I'm going to pick up some specs and read them(well, again)...

* [W3C vs. WHATWG HTML5 Specs â€“ The Differences Documented](http://developer.telerik.com/featured/w3c-vs-whatwg-html5-specs-differences-documented/)
* [WHATWG HTML Spec: Web Developer Edition](https://developers.whatwg.org/): Uh, I think I like IDLs more...This one isn't really my type
* I think I should list out what I am interested in..

### Map

Dumped it in my Baidu Naotu :) Basiclly a summary of the WHATWG spec.

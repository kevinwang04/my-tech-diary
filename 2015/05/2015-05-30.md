* [Improving ng-repeat Performance with “track by”n](http://www.codelord.net/2014/04/15/improving-ng-repeat-performance-with-track-by/)

So without track-by, angular will link your objects and the DOM by using a generated hash(`$$hashKey`). If one of them changes, the hash will be regenerated. If you use track-by to explicitly specifies what can be used as identifiers(in the collection for `ng-repeat`), then angular will just use that identifier, therefore improve the performance significantly.

## Git

### [Announcing GitTorrent: A Decentralized GitHub](http://blog.printf.net/articles/2015/05/29/announcing-gittorrent-a-decentralized-github/)

> Isn’t Git already decentralized?

> I don’t think so, and to explain why I’d like you to imagine someone arguing that we can do without BitTorrent because we have FTP.

1. Get the hash(connect to GitHub):

  ```bash
  git clone gittorrent://github.com/cjb/recursers
  ```
  And GitHub will return a hash for the latest commit
2. Fetch the repo. This is done by using BitTorrent protocol. There is a distributed hash table in the GitTorrent network.
3. Smart protocol: a BitTorrent extension, negotiate packed commits on the git graph. The remote node will make a packfile for a commit and its parents, tell you the hash, then you can get the packfile from it and any other nodes seeding it.
4. To avoid the initial connection to GitHub, you can distribute your repo by giving others a hash instead of a GitHub URL, so the cloning looks like:

  ```bash
  git clone gittorrent://81e24205d4bac8496d3e13282c90ead5045f09ea/recursers
  ```
  Then the clients will use the DHT to find out what is the latest version of this repo, and ask for that commit.

  This is made possible by using a BitTorrent extension that allows the nodes to maintain a network-wide key-value store.
5. To avoid the long, impossible-to-remember hashed username, GitTorrent borrows the idea from BitCoin’s BlockChain. A mechanism of distributed consensus will verify a user's identity. So the cloning now looks like:

  ```bash
  git clone gittorrent://cjb/foo
  ```

The repo is [cjb/gittorrent](https://github.com/cjb/gittorrent).

## Service worker

### [Introduction to Service Worker](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/service-worker/introduction/)

* For tasks that don't need a web page
  * e.g. push notification, background tasks
* Can't access the DOM(coz it's a worker!), uses the `postMessage` interface.
* Its lifetime is not controlled by the developer, persistent state could be stored in indexDB.
* Promises!
* It needs HTTPS(or localhost when in development)
* Register -> install -> activation -> idle -> fetch/message -> terminated(usually because the memory runs out)

#### Register

```javascript
if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
  navigator.serviceWorker.register('/sw.js').then(function(registration) {
    // Registration was successful
    console.log('ServiceWorker registration successful with scope: ',    registration.scope);
  }).catch(function(err) {
    // registration failed :(
    console.log('ServiceWorker registration failed: ', err);
  });
}
```

* The browser will make sure it won't be registered repeatedly

...To be continued.

## Web Components

### [Let’s build some apps with Polymer! - Chrome Dev Summit 2014 (Rob Dodson)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV0hgdMpH28)

GitHub repo: [robdodson/contacts-app](https://github.com/robdodson/contacts-app)

#### Structure

* `<div>`s!
* `<core-toolbar>` inside `<core-header-panel>` or `<core-scroll-header-panel>`
* `<paper-menu-button>`, `<paper-icon-button>`, `<paper-dropdown>`
  * `<core-menu>` with `<paper-item>`s
* `icon` for icons, `flex` just like css flex, `condenss` give you a cross-fade effect
* Responsive `<core-drawer-panel>` with `drawer` and `main`
* `<core-list>` is lazy with `<templates>` materialized by `{{ model }}`s
* `<core-image>` can be `preload`ed
* `<core-list scrollTarget="{{$.coreHeaderPanelId.scroller}}"` to make it work
* `<core-animated-pages>` with `<sections>` and `transitions` for them

#### Transition

1. The JavaScript way: change the `pages.selected` on route change
  * Lazy load with `Polymer.import`
2. The markup way
  * `<app-router>`

#### Performance

* Check native WC support before using polyfills
* vulcanize your components into one file so you can gzip them

#### Offline

* Use ServiceWorker to cache it offline

## Edge

### [JavaScript moves forward in Microsoft Edge with ECMAScript 6 and beyond](http://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2015/05/12/javascript-moves-forward-in-microsoft-edge-with-ecmascript-6-and-beyond/)

#### Class

Spec changed late in the process...well, wait for update.

#### Default parameters
Intermediate scope of default parameter initializers are particularly hard to implement.

Chakra can handle this:

```javascript
function fn() { return "outside" }

function outer(a = fn()) {
  function fn() { return "inside" }
  return a;
}

outer();  // should return "outside"
```

But not this (yet):

```javascript
let x = "outside";

function outer(a = () => eval("x")) {
  let x = "inside";
  return a();
}

outer();  // should return "outside"
```

(Wow...May I say that the second one is just pure evil....)

#### Generators

The spec later added `return()` to the iterator interface, which would alter behaviors of other language features. They need time to catch up on that.

#### Trickery

1. Phishing
  * Old: HTTPS lock symbol, EV Cert green bar
  * New: Windows 10 Microsoft Passport, no need to send plain-text password
2. Malicious Websites and Downloads
  * SmartScreen: reputation check
3. Fake Sites
  * Certificate reputation
4. Web Standards
  * [IETF HTTP Strict Transport Security](https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-ietf-websec-strict-transport-sec-14.txt)
  * [W3C Content Security Policy 1.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/2012/CR-CSP-20121115/)

#### Hacking

1. A new extension model, get rid of ActiveX
2. Microsoft Edge as a Universal Windows App
  * New process model
  * App container sandbox by default(since ActiveX is gone)
  * 64-bit by default, stronger Windows ASLR


### [A break from the past, part 2: Saying goodbye to ActiveX, VBScript, attachEvent…](http://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2015/05/06/a-break-from-the-past-part-2-saying-goodbye-to-activex-vbscript-attachevent/)

#### Why these are gone in Edge
* ActiveX and BHO
  * HTML5 is powerful enough
  * PDF viewer and Flash will be built in
  * A new extension model is coming
* Document modes
  * Living mode
  * Just use `about://flags` for experimental feature, the stable ones will be turned on by default
* VML
  * We have SVG now
* VBScript
  * JavaScript is enough
* `attachEvent` / `removeEvent`
  * DOM Level 3 `addEventListener`/`removeEventListener` since IE9
* `currentStyle`
  * DOM Level 2 `getComputedStyle` since IE9
* Conditional comments
  * Feature detection is the right way to go
* IE8 layout quirks
  * (It sucks)
* DirectX Filters and Transitions
  * We have CSS3 and SVG

#### Vender prefixes
* Remove many `-ms`, added many `-webkit` (...WTF)
* Only for compatibility
* Prefer `about:flags`
* Maybe [API trials](https://air.mozilla.org/web-compatibility-summit-talks/)

## [Deku: How we built our functional alternative to React](https://segment.com/blog/deku-our-functional-alternative-to-react/)

* Doesn't support old browsers, smaller codebase (< 10kb)
* Initially a rendering loop with dirty checks
* An optimized [diffing algorithm](https://github.com/segmentio/deku/blob/master/lib/render.js#L492)
* [Uses ES6 modules](https://github.com/segmentio/deku/blob/master/docs/guides/components.md) instead of classes and `this` (WOW!) 


## [The Microsoft Edge Rendering Engine that makes the Web just work](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/WebPlatformSummit/2015/The-Microsoft-Edge-Rendering-Engine-that-makes-the-Web-just-work)

### What we can do
1. Avoid UA sniffing if you can. Do feature detection.
2. If you are isolating a bug, sniff for **a specific browser version**(so that the updated browser won't be affected)
3. Make sure the **default path**(meaning unknown browser) assumes **correct behavior**

So prefer this:

```javascript
// prefer this
if (window.someFeature)
  ...
```

and when you have to do browser sniffing, do something like this:

```javascript
if (goodBrowsers.includes(browser)) {
  useWhatYouNeed();
} else if (browser === aBuggyOne && browserVersion === aBuggyVersion)
  fixThings();
} else {  // unkonwn browser
  useWhatYouNeed();
}
```

### Priority
1. Regression from IE11
2. What is used by real sites, which works in other browsers(might not be standardized yet)
3. What they guess would be needed for the websites to work properly
4. W3C standards which don't receive much popularity

#### Examples
1. Font resource handling
  * W3C spec says that browsers need to check CORS and installibility of the font before using web fonts
  * Icon fonts might not work, which could be a big problem
  * IE and Firefox do that, but WebKit doesn't. Edge follows WebKit.
2. Implement `-webkit-appearance`
3. Gradients
4. `innerHTML`/`children` of orphans

### Data-driven design
* Insiders program, send :( or :)
* Bing crawler: EdgeHTML + Instrumentation -> Crawler
  * Detect popular usages(like `-webkit-apperance`)
  * Rewriting XPath in CSS selectors fixes 94%, with tweaks 97%, with wicked-good-xpath 100%

## [What’s New in F12 for "Project Spartan"](https://channel9.msdn.com/events/Build/2015/3-638)
* Tools for IE 11 on Win10+ are going to be **frozen**!!
* Edge will cover much more features common in browsers
* Unique features in Edge:
  * Track changes (uh...Chrome has that (workspace) since, like, two years ago?)
  * Just my code (well...Both Chrome and Firefox already have some sort of blackbox thing in the JS debugger...)

### Demos

#### F12 for embedded IE
* `F12Chooser.exe` will enumerate all IE instances to let you choose between them
* Also available in VS
* These tools are built with HTML-CSS-TypeScript
* You can debug F12 with F12 LOL
* Keep shortcuts the same as other browsers

#### Brand new network tool
* Network tool is on without F12
* Plan to add cookie editor(for now it is read-only)
* HAR Support

#### TypeScript goodies
* **This is awesome**
* Go to definition
* Find references

#### Some not-so-new features
* Event breakpoints(finally!)
* Async call stack
* Source maps
* Source file reminder for console.log(also works for source maps)
* CSS pre/postprocessors with source maps will also have **go to definition** (uh..without ctags?)

#### Brand new profiling tool (finally)
* [User Timing API](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webperformance/usertiming/)(Yeah I am looking at you, FireFox!)
* Jump from performance tool to DOM inspector(with highlights)
* Uses CPU sampling instead of instrumented page to reduce overhead on profiling
* First time is always slower because the JIT didn't take effects
* F12 turns on debug mode for JS so it affects the data recorded by `window.performance`, this is a problem when you are sending performance statistics from users' machine to your server. Plan to add a control to disable debug mode.
* Snapshots (nah...other browsers have it already)
  * `console.takeHeapSnapshot()`

## ["Project Spartan": Introducing the New Browser and Web App Platform for Windows 10](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2015/2-656)

* Will be updated frequently
* No more ActiveX and VBScript
* Hosted Web Apps(have a URL in the manifest) can access **Universal Windows API** via JavaScript (device, etc. things that are not in the standard)
  * Feature detect `window.Windows`
  * e.g. Create an appointment

    ```javascript
    if (window.Windows) {
      Windows.ApplicationModel.Appointments.Appointment();
    }
    ```
* **Rolling releases** like Windows 10
* Certification: a team working on regular reviews, focusing on apps with many customer complaints

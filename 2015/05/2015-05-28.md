## [Dev tools]

### [Mozilla Releases Major Update to CSS Animation Inspector in Firefox Developer Edition](http://www.infoq.com/news/2015/05/firefox40-network-monitoring?utm_campaign=infoq_content&utm_source=infoq&utm_medium=feed&utm_term=global)

Tried the animation tool in Firefox Dev, looks nice.

## JS

### [Loupe](http://latentflip.com/loupe/)

Visualize call stack/event loop/callback queue, it's awesome!

### [JavaScript as a Protocol for Native Development](http://dailyjs.com/2015/05/27/javascript-as-a-protocol-for-native-development/)

They think use JS to implement a (high-level, custom) protocol, then expose it to another native environment(since JS VM is everywhere nowdays) is better than writing a RFC specification and let others implement it using different languages in different native environments. Sounds resonable to me.

### [Let's learn React.js and server side rendering! ](https://github.com/tako-black/learnyoureact)

Oh, the CLI game again!

## HTML5

### Aria(Accessible Rich Internet Applications)

* [Periodic Table of ARIA 1.0 attributes](http://dylanb.github.io/periodic-aria-attributes.html)
* [Periodic Table of ARIA 1.0 Roles](http://dylanb.github.io/periodic-aria-roles.html)
* [An overview of accessible web applications and widgets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/An_overview_of_accessible_web_applications_and_widgets)
* [ARIA examples](http://heydonworks.com/practical_aria_examples/)

Maybe try it on my next project.

## Helpers

### [Keycodes - Javascript Keyboard Codes, Character Codes, Unicode, HTML Entities](http://keycodes.atjayjo.com/)

This looks helpful, but it is based on Mac keyboard, and doesn't have directional keys. Maybe I could do a PC version(American keyboard layout).

### [CSS Filters Playground](http://bennettfeely.com/filters/)

Simple & easy.

### [nip - Node Input/output Piper](https://github.com/kolodny/nip)

JS instead of awk/grep/sed.

Example: 

```bash
nip 'function(l) { return /^var/.test(l); }' lines-that-start-with-var.txt
```

## Node.js

### [Diving into C++ internals of node](https://blog.indutny.com/c.cpp-in-node)

* Talked about some V8 optimization...well I already know them.
* Commit history of node:
  * `git log deps/v8` and `git log src/`

#### Start: [61890720](https://github.com/nodejs/io.js/commit/61890720)

* Dependencies
  * libebb: HTTP parser
  * liboi: TCP server framework on top of libev
* New Structure:
  * `server.cc`: setup V8, pass CLI arguments to JS
  * `js_http_request_processor.cc`: invokes HTTP request handler
* One C++ instance per request, maps HTTP fields to JS object

#### API wrapper: [064c8f02](https://github.com/nodejs/io.js/commit/064c8f02)

* API
  * `ObjectWrap` base class, maps between C++ and JS
* Dependencies
  * Uses libev.
* New Structure:
  * `src/node.cc`: setup C++ libraries, invoke `src/main.js` for initialization
    * From this point, things started to be written in JS as possible
  * `src/http.cc`: `http` module
  * `src/file.cc`, `src/file.js`: `fs` module
  * `src/process.cc`: later the `process` object
  * `src/timers.cc`: timers

#### v0.2

* Seperate JS and C++, added CommonJS, lots of new modules.
* API
  * `ObjectWrap` became public API
  * C++ interfaces no longer global, wrapped in `process.binding`
New structure:
  * `lib/` for CommonJS core modules
  * `src/` their C++ counterparts
  * `deps/`: V8, http-parser, c-ares(async DNS), libeio(async FS), libev(async networking and other stuff)

#### Milestone: v0.6

* Dependencies
  * libev -> libuv
* Support for Windows
* Single event-loop for both async fs and async networking

#### v0.12 and io.js

* Transition from `ObjectWrap`(`src/node_object_wrap.h`) to `AsyncWrap`(`src/async-wrap.h`)

#### Walk-through

* `lib/fs.js`: nothing interesting, just passing the file descriptor between C++ and JS
* `lib/net.js`:  `tcp_wrap` and `stream_wrap` binding
  * `TCP`: holds the socket, r/w stuff
  * `TCPConnectWrap`, `WriteWrap`, `ShutdownWrap` will be passed to `TCP` methods to do async operation and invoke callbacks


Check [this](https://github.com/nodejs/io.js/blob/master/lib/net.js#L763) out:

> the normal workflow for `net.connect()` follows:
>
> 1. Create `TCP` instance in `lib/net.js`, store it in the `_handle` property of the `net.Socket` object
> 2. Parse all arguments to `net.connect()`
> 3. Create `TCPConnectWrap` instance (usually named `req`)
> 4. Invoke `.connect()` method with `req`, `port`, `host`
> 5. Get `req.oncomplete` function invoked eventually, once the connection was established, or once the kernel reported an error

C++ classes are mostly handles(live longer) or requests(lives no longer than handles).

#### C++ structure

* `node.cc` register bindings using `NODE_MODULE_CONTEXT_AWARE_BUILTIN`
  * Each time `process.binding('moduleName')` is invoded, `node.cc` will look it up and initialize it
  * Note this:

    ```javascript
    process.binding = function(moduleName) {
      var module = modules[moduleName];
      if (module.initialized)
        return module.exports;

      module.exports = {};
      module.initFn(module.exports);
      return module.exports;
    };
    ```
* Exported classes are bound to some C++ classes, usually derived from `AsyncWrap`
* Handles are GC'ed by V8, `*Wrap`s goes with the handle
* Two type of references from C++ to JS: normal and weak
  * `AysncWrap`s by default are normally referenced, V8 won't GC them until C++ dispose the reference
  * Weak reference are created by `MakeWeak` in C++

* Jank if you can't finish the calculation within 60ms
* GC stop the world

#### Generations
* Allocation is cheap until the memory pool is exhausted
* Young generation
  * Allocates  & collects fastly
  * Frequently collected
  * High death-reate
* Old genreation
  * Allocates fastly but collects slowly
  * Not frequently collected
  * Long life-time
* **Usually it's the young generation that causes the janking**, cause old generation tends to live long

#### Young generation GC
* To-space and from-space, splited equally
* To-space provide memory for `new`
* From-space is used during GC
* When to-space runs out of memory, collection is triggered
  1. To and from **swaps** their space
  2. **Mark** live variables in from-space(swapped in in 1), and **copy** them to the to-space(this is where the cost goes)
  3. To-space now has more memory for allocation since dead variables are not in it

#### Optimization and depotimization

1. **Allocation** draws you closer to collection, so **pre-allocate** as possible
  * Audit your code, make sure there is as few `new` or `var`(implicit `new`) in frames as possible
  * V8 can optimize some implicit `new`, but not until it is hot
2. If the code is depotimized to many times or has certain code construct(like try-catch/for-in), it will **stay unoptimized** forever!!
3. **Change of hidden class** will deoptimized the code too

#### Analyze

```bash
# v8.log will show up in cwd
$ Chrome --no-sandbox --js-flags="--prof --noprof-lazy --log-timer-events"
# These tools needs to be built with V8
$ tools/plot-timer-events /path/to/v8.log
# platform can be mac etc.
$ tools/platform-tick-processor /path/to/v8.log
$ Chrome --no-sandbox --js-flags="--trace-deopt --trace-opt-verbose" > some.log
# search for "disable optimization"
```
Note GCScavenger.

* Trick: for un-optimizable constructs, **seperate the optimizable code into a function** so that the function could still be optimized

Looks nice, but it seems not finished yet.


## Rust

### [Stanford Seminar - Aaron Turon of Mozilla ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5vzLKg7y-k)

No runtime, memory safety without GC, no data race.

#### Ownership and borrowing

Root of evil: aliasing + mutation:

1. **Ownership** eliminates aliasing: `(T)`
  * Only one owner(can do mutation) at any given time
  * Plain type for argument implies **transfer of ownership**
  * If the original owner wants to access the resource after transfer, compiler will complains
  * Destruction will be determined by the new owner
2. **Shared borrowing()** eliminates mutation: `(& T)`
  * If there is aliasing, no mutation is allowed
  * If the borrower wants to mutate the resource, compiler will complains
  * Destruction will be determined by the original owner
3. **Mutable borrowing** restrict aliasing
  * Only one can borrow it at a time: `(&mut T)`
  * Compiler will make sure there is only one borrower at a time
    * And the same code can't be both a mutable borrower and a shared borrower
  * Destruction will be determined by the original owner

#### Concurrency

Root of evil: aliasing + mutation + no ordering.

Actor model(e.g. erlang) forbid aliasing, functional model(e.g. haskell) forbit mutation. Rust forbid both from happening simutaneously.

1. Message passing => transfer of owenership
  * e.g. the ownership of the sending end of a channel gets transfered, while the one creating the channel still retains the receiving end(but it will lose the sending end once it gets transfered)
2. Shared read-only access
  * Maintained by ARC(Atomic Reference Counter)
  * Destroyed when no one references it anymore
  * Arc owns it: `Arc(T)`, others can only borrow it: `&T`
  * Safe Arc, unsafe Rc
3. Locked mutatble access
  * `Mutex`
  * Destructor takes the lock, get a mutable reference to the data
  * Locks will be automitically released when the destructor's life ends
  * You can't touch the lock unless you own the lock -- ensures criticle section

#### Parallelism

* Split and join must appear together so that the stack won't be reclaimed
* Spawn is static, join is dynamic
* Compiler provides type checking

#### Unsafe

* Implementation can be unsafe, but public API must guarentee safety
* Audit by search for `unsafe`
* Tools and expreience

* That multi-core layout thing of servo is dope. Just dope.
* Rust-FFI-Python seems super easy.

* Generations: young pool
  * Becomes old when the pool run out of memory
  * Garbage: objects that cannot be referenced by the root
  * Better not do any `new` in per-frame operations
* A few tips
  * Incognito window to avoid interference from extensions
  * Ignore dimmed and parenthesed stuff in heap snapshot
  * GC takes place before taking snapshot
* Paterns
  * **Sign of memory leak**: you click the GC button, and the memory usage still stays up
  * Compare snapshots before and after some operation, and pay attention to the number of **deleted** objects -- if they are not deleted as you expected, you got a leak.
  * Normal background = **not yellow** = cannot be acessed from JS handles -- though you might be able to access them by walking the DOM
  * **Red** = in detached DOM, cannot be accessed by walking the DOM
  * Pay attention to event handlers
* Gotchas
  * The **integer tagging** of V8 might make some intergers invisible in the containment graph(should have been references/pointers, but V8 turns them into memories storing integers)
  * Sometimes things disapper in the heap snapshot beacause their **getters** are very expensive to call

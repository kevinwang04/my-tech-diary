## OpenGL

## CH1

What you usually do in C++:

```cpp
struct Object
{
    int count;
    float opacity;
    char *name;
};

//Create the storage for the object.
Object newObject;

//Put data into the object.
newObject.count = 5;
newObject.opacity = 0.4f;
newObject.name = "Some String";
```

will look like this if written the OpenGL-way:

```cpp
//Create the storage for the object
GLuint objectName;
// generate an [Object], 1 is number of [Object],
// &objectName will get the allocated id
glGenObject(1, &objectName);

//Put data into the object.
//Needs to be bound to a context=target first
//Bound to GL_MODIFY
glBindObject(GL_MODIFY, objectName);
//Set parameters
glObjectParameteri(GL_MODIFY, GL_OBJECT_COUNT, 5);
glObjectParameterf(GL_MODIFY, GL_OBJECT_OPACITY, 0.4f);
glObjectParameters(GL_MODIFY, GL_OBJECT_NAME, "Some String");
```

Binding object 0 means to unbind the currently bound object.

## Native v.s. Web

Scrollbar hijacking is really a bad idea, I agree. It feels wrong to take over the browser's job (loading, selection, etc.), because the browsers can always do it better -- well, since the browser is native.

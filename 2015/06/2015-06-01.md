## Design

### [Google I/O 2014 - Material design principles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isYZXwaP3Q4)

1. Metaphor
  * Metaphors are like stories, so they are powerful. People can think less when using it.
2. Surface
  * **Why paper**? Because they have been carrying information through out the history
  * But not constrained by natural laws
3. Dimensionality affords interaction
  * **Why ripples** instead of fake push-down buttons? Because your finger will never feel the push-down. Ripples are much more natural.
4. Content
  * Bold typography, grids, color palettes
  * Dynamic colors, accent color
5. Icons
  * Real-life shadows, geometric shapes
6. Users initiate change
  * Response should be **immediate**.
  * Response should **start from** where the user touches.
7. Animations should live in the same world
  * Expansion & shadows.
  * Transitions happen **around the selected object**.
8. Motions
  * **Slide** instead of fade(which is more meaningful).

#### Q&A

* **Why circles**?
  * Serve as emphasis without motion.
  * Stands out in the shape palette(simple = geometric shapes)
  * Propogate as circle in physics. Radiation.
* Different screen sizes
  * Still not automatic enough
  * Provide guidelines, but still need a human for decisions.
* ...

>  An optical family contains styles specifically optimized for each size and use case – rather than trying to be one-size-fits-all, like many of the typefaces common on the Web.

## UI

### [第6回勉強会 フレームワークの世界まる見え！JS特捜部　～ React,Angular,WinJSだらけの2時間SP！～](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIkXfc4rowU)

#### Angular2
* Moves properties to prototype of DOM elements
* `(click)="click()"`, `[value]="val"`
* ui-router uses `<ng-outlet>` instead of `<ng-viewport>`
* AtScript adds Annotations and Introspection to TypeScript
* Sever-side rendering
* NPM CLI
* Shadow DOM

#### WinJS
* Rich control
* Promise, scheduler, XHR, data binding, templates & fragments, routing
* Angular directive
* i18n: e.g. `js/en-US/ui.string.js`
* Link a CSS theme and `WinJS.min.js`, then:

  ```javascript
  (function() {
    WinJS.UI
    .processAll()
    .then(function() {
      // App code here
    })
  })();
  ```
* In the markup, use `data-win-*`
* In callbacks, use `this.win*`
* To use it with Angular, add `angular-winjs`, then inject dependencies:

  ```javascript
  var module = angular.module('App', ['winjs']);
  ```


## Network

### [SPDY & HTTP 2 with Akamai CTO Guy Podjarny](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkLBrHW4NhQ)

### SPDY

* Compressed headers, header reuse
* Parallelism, true multiplexing, fragments
* Client can mark priorities for resource requests
* Server push after the first request
  * e.g. push CSS instead of waiting for the browser notice the reference in HTML
  * Server hint to avoid pushing cached contents
* Use HTTPS to make routers/gateways/proxies that cannot handle SPDY tunnel it.
  * **So SPDY needs HTTPS**

### [Fluent 2015: Demystifying SPDY and HTTP/2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaYsG2Tcdq4)

* HTTP/2 is based on SPDY
* Chrome will remove SPDY in 2016 and replace it with HTTP/2

#### HTTP Head-of-line blocking
* Aha! I think this is the devil behind some strange browser behavior I discovered in an old project(when using `Promise.all`).
* HTTP/2 solve this problem by multiplexing -- interleave multiple req/res on the same connection(fragments!)
* This improvement makes a lot of *best practices* for HTTP 1.x meaningless
  * CSS and JS concatenation
  * Inlining small CSS/JS
  * Image sprites
  * DataURIs
  * **Domain sharding**

#### HPACK

* Done by using a header table. Reference the changed fields in the header.
* Not zlib to avoid session hijacking

#### Request Prioritization and Server Push

* Client can decline them
* Obey same-origin policy

#### Gotcha

* Firefox and Chrome require HTTPS for HTTP/2
* These are going to hurt if you switch to HTTP/2
  * Inlining content(cannot be cached)
  * Domain sharding(more TCP connections than you need)

## ES6

### [ES6 In Depth: Destructuring](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2015/05/es6-in-depth-destructuring/)

* Nesting: `[foo, [[bar], baz]] = [1, [[2], 3]]`
* Skipping: `[, , foo] = [1, 2, 3]`
* Spreading: `[foo, ...tail] = [1, 2, 3]`
* Missing: `[missing] = []`
* Defaults
* OMG they are way more powerful than I remember!

  ```javascript
let foo = ["1", [{b: 1}, 5, 4, 3]];
let [bar, [{b: baz}, , ...tail], missing, withdef = 4] = foo;
  // bar = "1", baz = 1, tail = [4, 3], missing = undefined, withdef = 4
  ```
* Defaults for objects are not supported in firefox yet though: [Bug 932080 - Support default values in destructuring ](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=932080)

#### Gotcha

* The right-hand side must be declared first(`var` or `let` or `const`) if it is an object(because JS engine thinks braces mean blocks)
* Or you can wrap the assignment in `()`

  ```javascript
  { blowUp } = { blowUp: 10 };  // Syntax error
  ({ blowUp } = { blowUp: 10 });  // OK!
  ```
* If the left-hand side is an array, the right-hand side must have an iterator.
* If the left-hand side is an object, th right-hand side must be "coercible to an object"

#### Use case

1. Like python `**` magic.

  ```javascript
  function foo({bar, baz}) {}
  ```
2. No need for `var foo = config.foo || theDefaultFoo`, just use defaults
3. On iterators

  ```javascript
  for (var [key, value] of map) {}

  for (var [key] of map) {}

  for (var [,value] of map) {}
  ```
4. Multiple return values

  ```javascript
  function foo() { return {bar, baz} };

  let {bar, baz} = foo();
  ```
5. Combined with CommonJS modules

  ```javascript
  // in module
  module.exports = {thing1: 1, thing2: 2};
  // in client
  const {thing1, thing2} = require('module');
  ```

### [From ASM.JS to WebAssembly](https://brendaneich.com/2015/06/from-asm-js-to-webassembly/)

#### [WebAssembly](https://github.com/WebAssembly)

* `.wasm`
* Binary, low-level(bytecode)
* Currently more like asm.js, but **will diverge from JS**
* Will still stay equivalent for a while for polyfills via JS
* SIMD
* Zero-cost exceptions, dynamic linking, call/cc

#### Why

* Hot parser for asm.js
* JS is still a bit awkward
* JS and wasm **can diverge**, so no need to introduce inappropriate features into JS(IMO this is the most important point)

#### [FAQ](https://github.com/WebAssembly/design/blob/master/FAQ.md)

* Why
  * 20x faster parsing(native)
  * Being not that much like JS makes it better as a low-level binary format. You don't need to care about AOT-compilability/performace in non-asm.js environment
* Cost
  * Spec that allows implementation inside **existing JS engine**
  * Reuse of JS engine backend, ES6 module loading frontend, sandboxs, other VM components
* C/C++
  * Reuse a modular C++ library like a module import from JS
  * Allocate and access GC objects(JS, DOM, Web API)
* It is possible to compile a C/C++ VM(e.g. Python) to wasm, but...
  * The footprint will be HUGE!
  * No devtools
  * Cross-language cycle-collections
  * Optimizations are hard
  * So, compiled languages are much more suitable
* Debugging
  * Defines a text format(like asm)
  * Can be displayed via View Source
* About JS
  * It's a **complement, not a replacement**
  * JS will still be the single, privileged dynamic languages of the Web
    * As mentioned before, it's not likely that you would want a VM compiled to wasm, so other dynamic languages are no-go
* Example combinations of JS and other languages
  * C++ apps, JS as glue(like bash/python)
  * HTML/CSS/JS UI + a canvas controlled by wasm(e.g. WebGL)
  * HTML/CSS/JS app + high-performance wasm add-ons(e.g. for processing, numerical computations)

Wow...Wait a minute, they've got the three largest mobile platforms and two browser OSs, what are they up to?!

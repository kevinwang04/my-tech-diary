## ES6

### [ES6 In Depth: Collections](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2015/06/es6-in-depth-collections/)

A few side notes -- Why can't we just copy an existing module system from another language? Because JS needs **asynchronous** module loading!!

FYI, CommonJS in Node is synchronous, so `require()` is slow.

#### Why we still needs collections when we have objects

* Lookup table + methods = risk of collision, so you need `Object.create(null)`, because normal objects have their prototype chains leading to `Object`, you get `toString` and whatnot.
* Only strings/symbols can be keys. What happens if you want **an object to be your key**?
* There is no efficient way to know **the size(number of keys) of your object**
* In ES6, you can't loop through plain objects with `for-of` and can't spread them with `...` since they **don't have built-in iterators**

So in ES6:

* You can't get data via `collection[key]`, you need to `collection.get(key)`
* Data in collections won't be inherited

#### Set

* It can have any value as its member(objects, etc.)
* `.has()` is much faster than `indexOf()`
* Operations
  1. `new Set()` and `new Set(iterable)`
  2. `set.size`
  3. `set.has(value)`, `set.add(value)`, `set.delete(value)`, `set.clear(value)`
  4. `set[Symbol.iterator]()`, `set.keys()`, `set.values()`, `set.entries()` and `set.forEach()`
* Lacks
  * Functional helpers like `.map()`, `.filter()`
  * Union and intersections
  * Add all/has all/delete all

#### Map

* Operations
  1. `New Map()`, `new Map(map)`, `new Map(pairs)`(`pairs` should be like `[["foo", 2], ["bar", 3]]` or a generator generating two-elements arrays)
  2. `map.size`
  3. `map.has(key)`, `map.get(key)`, `map.set(key, value)`, `map.delete(key)`
  4. `map[Symbol.iterator]()`, `map.keys()`, `map.values()`, `map.entries()` and `map.forEach()`
* Lacks
  * Default values like python's `collections.defaultdict`
  * Object-to-map conversion

#### Glitches & Surprises

* JS doesn't have equality overloading, and you can't implement custom hash code for classes
* Collections in ES6 are **predictable**! They will be iterated in the order of insertion
  * The de-factor enumeration order on the Web is just...this...
  * It's really [not that slow](https://wiki.mozilla.org/User:Jorend/Deterministic_hash_tables) to track the order
* Putting DOM objects in a collection could cause memory leaks...the solution? Use a week collection!
  * Use case: tracking flags when adding symbols to a bunch of short-lived objects is not a good idea. a WeakMap/WeakSet would be better


#### WeakMap and WeakSet

* `WeakSet` and `WeakMap` don't have `.size` and functionalities about iterators
  * Only CRUD(1 and 3 above)
  * Not iterable
* Stored values must be objects(essentially, these are a bunch of **weak references**)
* These restrictions mean that weak collections **won't prevent GC** from cleaning out the objects they (weakly) references
* Implementations: [ephemeron tables](http://www.jucs.org/jucs_14_21/eliminating_cycles_in_weak/jucs_14_21_3481_3497_barros.pdf)

#### Why not just add weak references to JS?

1. Weak references expose details of GC behavior
2. Underlying details make compatibility issues worse
3. Hard to reason about

## Improvements on the diary

1. Update instructions about git submodules and branches
2. `gulp-webpack` is deprecated, use `webpack-stream` instead
3. Move CSS4 variables into one file and let the other files import them
4. Fix the unresponsive footer

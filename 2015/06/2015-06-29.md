### [Echo.js, simple JavaScript image lazy loading](http://toddmotto.com/echo-js-simple-javascript-image-lazy-loading/)

* `src` for place holder(should be small and can be cached nicely), `data-echo` for real images
* Use `DOMContentLoaded` event for `<head>`, fall back to `onload` for IE7/IE8
* In view:

  ```js
  var coords = element.getBoundingClientRect();
  return ((coords.top >= 0 && coords.left >= 0 && coords.top) <= (window.innerHeight || document.documentElement.clientHeight));
  ```
  Note that the `top` and `left` of a `DOMRect` is relative to the **top-left of the viewport**(e.g. element top - viewport top), so if the `top` is smaller than the viewport height, it must be in the view.
* Load: copy `data-echo` to `src`
* Cache all images with `data-echo` into an array (what `init()` does is to push an element into this array)
* When (1) the DOM is loaded, or (2) the user scrolls, loop through the cache, check if any elements is scrolled into view, load them if they are and remove them from the cache. `render()` is for the former(for first-screen experience), `listen()` is for the latter.
  * Use prototypes to organize the code
* The initiation is done by applying `init()` on `document.querySelectorAll('img[data-echo]')`


## Projects & Finals

### For the last project of CG

1. Use glm to load obj, and draw it onto the screen
2. Implement controls, lighting
3. Use glm to load mtl, FreeImage to load images, and combine them to draw materials
4. Use Qt to implement the menu.

### For the last project of CV

1. Figure out how to load MNIST data into numpy arrays(8x8 each, gray then binary then flip)
2. Use OpenCV/sklearn to do Haar training
  * Collect negative samples!
3. Use Adaboost to do detection
  * How to get a training set? hmm...
4. Use SVM to do recognition
  * This should be much simpler...

### For CG final

* Curves and surfaces
* Pipeline
* Scan line conversion/Bresenham
* Half-edge
* Transformations
* Lighting
* Z-buffer
* Normal calculation

## ES6

### [Moving to ES6 from CoffeeScript](https://gist.github.com/danielgtaylor/0b60c2ed1f069f118562)

#### Styles
* Use [ESLint](http://eslint.org/). [babel-eslint](https://github.com/babel/babel-eslint) can be a good choice.
* [Airbnb's style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) can be helpful.

#### Babel
* Proxies are not available even with transpiling.
* Symbols, generators, etc. needs runtime/polyfill.
* Note that you only needs `babel-runtime` for dependencies. `babel` is for dev-dependencies.

#### Declaration
`const` is applied to values themselves:

  ```javascript
  const options = {};
  const items = [];

  // This is *not* a compile error
  options.foo = 'bar';
  options.baz = 5;
  items.push(1);
  items.push(2);

  // This *is* a compile error
  options = {};
  items = null;
  ```

#### Ranges

```javascript
// Coffee (inclusive): [0..10]
range = Array.from(new Array(11).keys());

// Coffee (exclusive): [0...10]
range = Array.from(new Array(10).keys());

// Coffee (non-zero): [2...10]
range = Array.from(new Array(10).keys()).slice(2);

// Coffee (decrementing): [10...2]
range = Array.from(new Array(10).keys()).slice(2).reverse();
```

#### Class

Coffescript:

```coffeescript
class Account extends Foo
  @types = ['checking', 'savings']

  constructor: (@balance) ->

  history: (done) ->
    someLongTask (err, data) ->
      # Do something with data
      done null, data

  deposit: (amount) ->
    @balance += amount
```

JavaScript:

```javascript
class Account extends Foo {
  constructor(balance) {
    this.balance = balance;
  }

  history(done) {
    someLongTask((err, data) => {
      // Do something with data
      done(null, data);
    });
  }

  deposit(amount) {
    this.balance += amount;
    return this.balance;
  }
}


// Currently, you can only declare functions in a class
Account.types = ['checking', 'savings'];
```

You can define getters and setters with:

```javascript
class A {
  get aGetter() {
    return "foo" + 5;
  }
}
```

They can't be generators though.

And you can use `super`. But in ES6, only constructors can use `super()` directly, other methos need to use `super.methodName()`.

You can define a iterator for a class by defining:

```javascript
*[Symbol.iterator]() {
  //...
}
```

#### Modules

use `import * as moduleName from './path/to/module'`

## Ideas

Want to make something with the Web Audio API and Muse's new album...Reapers is my favorite, but Mercy(more melodic, has a layer of piano and simpler drum beats, no crazy riffs) / The Handler (very strong and regular drum beats, a bit more complicated) / Defector(just feels very visualizable) would be better choices for visualization (Damn! The chord progressions in this album tend to be too fast to visualize, though I really dig that...).

Not familiar enough with SVG, so I would probably go with CSS `clip-path`...But that might limit the support to WebKit browsers. Will think over it again.

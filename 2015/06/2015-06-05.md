### [ES6 In Depth: Arrow functions](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2015/06/es6-in-depth-arrow-functions/)

#### The naughty arrows
In the early days, to prevent browsers that doesn't support JS from choking on it, you can wrap JS code in HTML comments so that the browsers would ignore it, like this:

```html
<script language="javascript">
<!--
  document.bgColor = "brown";  // red
// -->
</script>
```

So in JS, `<!--` has the same effect as `//`, and this is even valid in Node(V8)! And ES6 finally [standardized it](http://people.mozilla.org/~jorendorff/es6-draft.html#sec-html-like-comments).

Notice that while `<!--` is part of JS now, `-->` isn't. Because `-->` itself is an operator(though you can just think of them as `--` and `>` together):

```javascript
while (n-->0) {
  // n goes to 0
}
```

#### Gotcha

`{}` can be an empty block or empty object, and in ES6, we prefer to treat it as a blcok. Also `{foo, bar}` can be a block(with some meaningless expressions) or an object literal shorthand, and we still prefer to treat it as a block.

So anytime you find yourself bugged by some strange behavior when using braces, try wrapping them in parentheses!

#### Use this rule to leave `this` hell

* For methods that will be called like `obj.method()`, use the good old `function(){}`
* For everything else, use arrows(if you are building something with `this` in mind).


#### Fixed-point combinator in ES6

```
fix = λf.(λx.f(λv.x(x)(v)))(λx.f(λv.x(x)(v)))
```

```javascript
var fix = f => (x => f(v => x(x)(v)))
               (x => f(v => x(x)(v)));
```

Immutable data structures. Looks handy!

Installed Google Analytics on my diary site! I can see the real time data coming in, but no reports yet. Apparently it takes a couple more hours to show up: [Google Analytics shows real time visitors but reflects 0 visitors historically](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12965646/google-analytics-shows-real-time-visitors-but-reflects-0-visitors-historically).

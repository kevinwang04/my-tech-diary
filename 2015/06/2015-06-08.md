### [Basics of Monkey Patching](http://davidwalsh.name/monkey-patching)

You don't want to modify the library code. It's will turn into a nightmare. Just monkey patch.

1. Keep a reference to the old code
2. Replace the method with a bug-fixed one(patch it on the library)
3. Take care.

Looks like a good tutorial. Maybe read it later.

## CSS

### Selection color

Spec: [CSS Pseudo-Elements Level 4(Working Draft)](http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-pseudo-4/#selectordef-selection)

```css
/* draw any selected text yellow on red background */
::-moz-selection { color: gold;  background: red; }
::selection      { color: gold;  background: red; } 
```

Needs IE9+. Firefox needs `-moz`.

## DOM

### Mouse Events

Made [this demo](http://joyeecheung.github.io/frontend-utils-and-demos/dom/mouse-events/)

* `mouseenter` and `mouseleave` doesn't bubble. They only gets fired when the mouse enter/leaves the element's space(might be lying under its children).
* `mouseover` and `mouseout` bubbles. They will be fired when the mouse enter/leaves the element's space, and when its children don't catch tehm, they will be fired on the element eventually.
* If you enter/leave a hierarchy at once(e.g. their border is overlapped), then `mouseenter` / `mouseleave` will be fired on everyone in the hierarchy. `mouselover` / `mouseout` will only be fired on the topmost element(usually a child), though they can bubbles up to the parent.
* So if your mouse is moving from one child to another, `mouseout` and `mouseover` could eventually be fired on the parent if the children don't stop the propagation, **even though conceptually you are not moving over or out of the parent**.

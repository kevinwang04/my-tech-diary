### Train cascade classifier with OpenCV

1. Run a script to draw small negative samples from random samples. I used caltech 101 and Chars74K.

  ```bash
  # generate 6000 100x100 negative samples
  python get_negative.py -w 100 --height 100 -n 6000
  ```
2. Generate positive.dat and negative.dat. Note that find and echo combined is quite slow, so I wrote a python script to do it.

  ```bash
  # generate information for 5000 28x28 positive samples
  python list_pos.py -w 28 --height 28 -n 5000
  # List paths of all .jpg negative samples
  find negative -name '*.jpg' > negative.dat
  ```
3. Create the .vec file for the positive samples. Then `opencv_createsamples` executable comes with the OpenCV package.

  ```bash
  # generate 5000 positive samples info by positive.dat and output into vector.vec
  # size of each positive sample is 28x28
  opencv_createsamples -info positive.dat -vec vector.vec -num 5000 -w 28 -h 28
  ```

  Verify the vec file you created(ESC to exit, close windows to see the next one)
  ```bash
  opencv_createsamples -vec vector.vec -w 28 -h 28
  ```

4. Train the samples

  ```bash
  rm -rf data
  mkdir data  # empty folder
  opencv_traincascade -data data -vec vector.vec -bg negative.dat -numPos 3000 -numNeg 6000 -w 28 -h 28 -numStages 10
  ```
  The results are in the `data` folder created in the commands, and the data for each stage is stored in `stagex.xml`

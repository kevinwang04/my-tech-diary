## Machine Learning

Turns out I can use [this code](https://github.com/joyeecheung/neural-network) I wrote last year again and again...=___,= All I need to do is tweaking the parameters.

Think of a trick to generate/obtain the classes:

```python
# num_class = y.max()  # if the labels in y is 1 - n
def to_class(y, num_class):
    X, _ = np.meshgrid(list(xrange(num_class)), list(xrange(y.shape[0])))
    return np.array(X == (y - 1)[:, None], dtype=np.float64)

nn.train(train_X, to_class(train_y, train_y.max()))
# remember to add 1 back to the labels
result = np.argmax(nn.fit(test_X), axis=1) + 1
```

## ES6

### [ES6 In Depth: Symbols](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2015/06/es6-in-depth-symbols/)

#### Why it's necessary

Note: they are a bit like `__something__` in Python/PHP.

Oftentimes you need flags: e.g. `obj.isMoving`. To avoid conflicts with others using the same name(string), you could try this:

```javascript
// get 1024 Unicode characters of gibberish
var isMoving = SecureRandom.generateName();

if (element[isMoving]) {
  smoothAnimations(element);
}
element[isMoving] = true;
```

But it would definitely be very hard to debug.

```javascript
// when it shows up in the error message...it would look like this:
console.log(isMoving);  // WTF?!
```

With symbols, life will be much easier:

```javascript
// create a unique symbol
var isMoving = Symbol("isMoving");

if (element[isMoving]) {
  smoothAnimations(element);
}
element[isMoving] = true;
console.log(isMoving); // Symbol(isMoving)
```

Library authors will love this!

#### Gotcha

* Symbols are a bit like array elements in that **you cannot reference them with dot notation** e.g. `obj.symbol`. You have to go with `obj[symbol]`.
* Symbols **have scopes**. That means there is much smaller chance for collisions.
* You can't implicitly convert symbols to strings. You need `String(sym)` or `sym.toString()`.

  ```javascript
  "your symbol is " + sym
  // TypeError: can't convert symbol to string
  `your symbol is ${sym}`
  // TypeError: can't convert symbol to string
  ```

#### A few things about the symbols

* Symbols are a bit like strings
  * **Immutable**
  * You can't set **properties** on symbols. If you try this in strict mode you will get a `TypeError`
* Symbols are a bit like objects
  * Every symbol is **unique**
  * You can easily create new ones
* You won't see them in `for-in` loops, `Object.keys(obj)` and `Object.getOwnPropertyNames(obj)`.
* You can, however, see them with `Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(obj)` and `Reflect.ownKeys(obj)`

#### How you can get a symbol

1. `Symbol()` or `Symbol(someString)`

  ```javascript
  let A = Symbol("foo");
  let B = Symbol("foo");
  console.log(A === B); // false
  ```
2. `Symbol.for(someString)`: useful when you need to share symbols

  ```javascript
  let A = Symbol.for("foo");
  let B = Symbol.for("foo");
  console.log(A === B); // true
  ```
3. Special symbols defined in the spec like `Symbol.iterator`

#### Special symbols

* `Symbol.iterator`: can be used with `for-of` loops
* `Symbol.hasInstance`: `object instanceof constructor` essentially calls `constructor[Symbol.hasInstance]` and pass it the `object`.
* `Symbol.unscopables` to prevent dynamic scoping from breaking the web
* `Symbol.match`: `str.match(obj)` essentially calls `obj[Symbol.match]` and pass it the `str`
  * This is different from ES5 where `obj` will be converted into string first, because it is supposed to be [`str.match(regexp)`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/match).
  * Libraries can provide custom string matching classes(your own `RegExp`) now!

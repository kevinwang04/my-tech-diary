### [Asynchronous JavaScript at Netflix by Matthew Podwysowski at JSConf Budapest 2015 ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8W5VVGO-jA)

* Events
  * Make you have to maintain a bunch of global states...not cool
* Promises
  * Can't be canceled
  * No "finally"

#### Events and arrays are both **collections**

`flatMap` is basically `map` then `mergeAll`.

```javascript
let getElementDrags = (elmt) =>
  dom.mousedown(elmt)
    .flatMap((md) =>  // merge mouseup and mousemove
      dom.mousemove(document)
        .takeUntil(dom.mouseup(elmt)
    );
);

getElementDrags(image)
  .forEach(moveImage);
```

And now we have first-class objects for the streams!(Yes, they are lazy).

#### This is awesome

```javascript
function getRowUpdates(row) {
  let scrolls = Rx.observable.fromEvent(document, 'scroll');
  let rowVisibilities =
    scrolls.debounce(50)
      .map((scrollEvent) => row.isVisible(scrollEvent.offset))
      .distinctUntilChanged()
      .share();
  let rowShows = rowVisibilities.filter((v) => v);
  let rowHides = rowVisibilities.filter((v) => !v);

  return rowShows
    .flatMap(Rx.Observable.interval(10))
    .flatMap(() => row.getRowData().takeUntil(rowHides))
    .toArray();
}
```

#### Now I can cancel!

```javascript
let authorizations =
  player.init().flatMap(() =>
    playAttempts.flatMap((movieId) =>
      player.authorize(movieId)  // merge play and authorize
        .retry(3)
        .takeUntil(cancels)  // oh yeah!
    )
);

// merge the events!
let subscription = authorizations.forEach(
  (license) => player.play(license),
  (error) => showDialog('Sorry')
);
```

#### Schedulers

* You can cancel events via the scheduler
* You can hook the scheduler into your UI (e.g. Angular's `$digest`)
* You can use it for deterministic testing
* `Rx.Scheduler.requestAnimationFrame` to make your CPU happier

#### Goodies

Observables can have backpressure:

* lossy: pausable, sample, throttle
* buffer, pausableBuffered, controlled

```javascript
let pausable = chattyObservable.pausableBuffered();
pausable.pause();
pausable.resume();
```

#### RxJS and Gererators

* `Rx.spawn()` can take a generator...you get the idea.
* [This](https://esdiscuss.org/notes/2014-06/async%20generators.pdf) looks amazing.

## Flux

### [Flux Tutorial - Writing a Simple App in Flux and React](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5E894TmHJg)

* View -> action -> dispatcher(broadcasting) -> store(listening)
* Assign an event emitter to the store
* Not really helpful....-___-

## C/C++

A useful trick:

```cpp
struct vec3 { 
  union {
    struct {
      float x, y, z;
    };
    float raw[3];
  }; 
};

vec3 v;
assert(&v.raw[0] == &v.x);
assert(&v.raw[1] == &v.y);
assert(&v.raw[2] == &v.z);
```

When passing the vector to function like `glVertexAttribPointer` that takes a raw initial address, a stride and a size, you can just pass in `vectors[0].raw` instead of the weird `&vectors[0].x`.

This(anonymous struct & union) is in C11, but not in C++ standard yet. Usually you need to turn on C11 on your compiler if you are compiling C, or turn on some extensions if you are compiling C++ (most C++ compilers support it).

## Web Audio

Looks interesting.

## Machine learning

### [Deep Learning Tutorial: Perceptrons to Machine Learning Algorithms | Toptal](http://www.toptal.com/machine-learning/an-introduction-to-deep-learning-from-perceptrons-to-deep-networks)

I wish I had read it last year when I was doing my AI projects...

## TODO

* Take out the hard-coded GA ID in the jade partial of my diary site
* Do some proper i18n for the resume generator
* GA my resume

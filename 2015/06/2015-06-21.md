## Require.js & Three.js

Use shim to make it work:

1. In main.js

  ```javascript
  requirejs.config({
    baseUrl: 'js',
    paths: {
      THREE: 'libs/three.min',
      OBJLoader: 'loaders/OBJLoader',
      MTLLoader: 'loaders/MTLLoader',
      OBJMTLLoader: 'loaders/OBJMTLLoader'
    },
    shim: {
      THREE: {
        exports: 'THREE'
      },
      OBJLoader: {
        deps: ['THREE'],
        exports: 'THREE.OBJLoader'
      },
      MTLLoader: {
        deps: ['THREE'],
        exports: 'THREE.MTLLoader'
      },
      OBJMTLLoader: {
        deps: ['THREE', 'MTLLoader', 'OBJLoader'],
        exports: 'THREE.OBJMTLLoader'
      }
    }
  });

  // js/app.js can be automatically imported
  requirejs(['app'], function(app) {
    app.init();
  });
  ```
2. In app.js

  ```javascript
  define('app', ['THREE', 'OBJMTLLoader'], function(THREE) {
    function init() {
      // set up the world
      loadObject(scene);
    }

    function loadObject(scene) {
      var loader = new THREE.OBJMTLLoader();

      loader.load('path/to/obj', 'path/to/mtl',
        function(object) {
          scene.add(object);
        });
    }

    return {
      init: init
    };
  });
  ```
3. In your HTML

  ```html
  <script data-main="/js/main" src="/js/require.js"></script>
  ```

## git lfs, bfg, some useful commands

Tried to use git lfs on Windows but the installation script doesn't really work...

Used [bfg](https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/) to clean out some large binary files accidentally committed before. It's dead simple:

1. Download the jar
2. Get the mirror

  ```bash
  git clone --mirror git://url.to.your/repo.git`
  ```
  What gets downloaded will not be like your normal clone, and it will be a folder named with `.git` at the end
3. Delete files/folders you don't want

  ```bash
  java -jar bfg.jar --delete-files *.mp3 repo.git
  java -jar bfg.jar --delete-folders tmp repo.git
  ```

  Tips: to see every files ever committed(even if it's deleted now):

  ```bash
  git log --pretty=format: --name-status | cut -f2- | sort -u
  ```

  To see the largest files(the last 10 can be any number you want):

  ```bash
  git ls-files | xargs ls -l | sort -nrk5 | head -n 10
  ```
4. If you are being paranoid(like me), clone the repo from this local mirror and check if it is working:

  ```bash
  git clone repo.git a-temp-folder
  ```
5. When you are done, cd to the .git folder, and do a `git push`. If you are still paranoid(like me), get a backup (clone a mirror) again and save it to somewhere safe :)

## Hot to reset your messed up workspace in Chrome

Don't know why but after I deleted some files previously added to the workspace, the devtool is messed up -- I can't see the dynamically loaded scripts(by require.js) in the Source tab, which is really annoying(I can see some `VMxxx main.js` in the console and jump to them by clicking on the links though, but I just can't see them in the Source tab and can't navigate through them)

I can get it work again in incongnito mode, so I guess it's caused by some corrupted files in my user data, but I am not used to work in incognito...I want my old devtools back. After a few googling I didn't find any good solution, so I decided to reset Chrome, which basically means clear out my user data: [Create a new browser user profile](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/142059?hl=en)

It's acually quite easy. I keep my user data synced through my Google account everyday, so after creating a new profile, I get everything back in a few seconds by syncing again ^^.

## Moved out diary config

Refactored the diary generator and wrote a README for it: [Commits Â· joyeecheung/diary](https://github.com/joyeecheung/diary/commits/master). Now the configurations are all moved into [config.js](https://github.com/joyeecheung/diary/blob/master/config.js) instead of being hard-coded in the code.
